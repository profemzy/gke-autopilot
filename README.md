# Terraform GKE-Autopilot
Simple Demo of GKE Autopilot using terraform 

Google introduced GKE Autopilot(https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/autopilot-overview)

Which seems interesting, time and hopefully also cost saving.

Ensure you enable needed Google Cloud APIs like:
- Compute Engine API

Enable Container Services
gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com
